# BlackjackProject

## Description
This program is meant to simulate a game of casino blackjack between a player (the user) and a dealer. Most of the usual rules of the game will be followed. At this moment, play has been simplified due to the developer's skill level. Both the player and dealer will be first dealt two cards. Then, the player will be given the option to hit or stand. Afterwards, the dealer will play their turn and a winner will be decided. The player will then be given the option to play another game.

## Difficulties and Lessons Learned
I've had a lot of difficulty just understanding how to move around a class, how to access methods and objects from other classes. But I'm finally beginning to feel much more comfortable with java basics. I can say that after this project, I've come away with a clearer understanding of object instantiation and how that works with regard to access modifiers. Also, I see that while it's important not to lose sight of the big picture, it's easy to feel overwhelmed thinking of every little thing that needs to be done. So I'll do my best just to focus on one task at a time or perhaps just one line at a time.
